# 🔐 Smart Home Intrusion Detection Project

## Introduction 🌐
With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes, the number of potential security vulnerabilities has significantly increased. This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to enhance the security of home networks by detecting cyber threats in real-time.

## Project Goals 🎯
- **Real-time detection** of threats such as port scans, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and data exfiltration.
- **Minimization of false positives** to ensure user experience is not disrupted.
- **Scalability** to accommodate a wide range of IoT devices without frequent retraining.

## Context 📚
The proliferation of connected devices, including smart lights, security cameras, and other IoT appliances, exposes homes to potential cyber threats. Our project leverages machine learning to differentiate between normal and suspicious behavior using data sourced from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobaaayoung/dataset-invade).

## Project Architecture 🏗️
### Key Steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍**: Visualization and analysis of network traffic trends and behaviors.
2. **Feature Engineering ⚙️**: Selection and transformation of critical variables for intrusion detection.
3. **Model Development and Evaluation 🧠**: Training classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks) and evaluating their performance using metrics such as precision and recall.

## Models and Technologies Used 🚀
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, etc.
- **Models**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks
